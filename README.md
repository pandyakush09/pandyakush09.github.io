### PROJECTS:
TextBook-GPT: AI mentor for Students Current
Implemented a student project utilizing cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, specifically leveraging the capabilities of
OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) technology. Developed a comprehensive understanding of deep learning concepts and applied
them to design and train a custom model for text generation and analysis.
Key achievements include fine-tuning the GPT model for specific project requirements, optimizing hyperparameters, and integrating the model
into an end-to-end solution. Successfully addressed challenges related to data preprocessing, model evaluation, and performance optimization.
Demonstrated proficiency in Python programming and familiarity with machine learning libraries.
Effectively documented the project, detailing the methodology, results, and key insights. Presented findings in a clear and concise manner,
showcasing strong communication skills. This hands-on experience with GPT technology has enriched my knowledge in the field of natural
language processing and positioned me as a candidate with practical experience in applying state-of-the-art AI techniques to real world projects.
